# **Coffee Spending Predictor App**

## **Project Overview**

The Coffee Spending Predictor App predicts how much a customer is likely to spend on coffee based on features such as coffee type, payment method, and other relevant inputs. The app provides an interactive interface where users can enter values and see instant predictions, along with visual insights into spending patterns.

## **Features**

* Predict customer coffee spending using input values.
* Interactive interface built with Streamlit.
* Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* Handles categorical features like coffee type and payment method.

---

## **Tools & Skills Used**

* Python – main programming language
* Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning
* Scikit-Learn – Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
* LabelEncoder – encode categorical features
* Streamlit – interactive web app
* Seaborn & Matplotlib – data visualizations

---



## **Future Improvements**

* Add more ML models for better accuracy.
* Deploy the app online for live access.
